# Sierpinski Triangle Fractal (PyTorch)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements the **Sierpinski Triangle** fractal using **PyTorch**.  
The Sierpinski Triangle is a famous fractal discovered by Polish mathematician **WacÅ‚aw SierpiÅ„ski**.  
It is formed by repeatedly removing the middle triangle from a larger equilateral triangle, creating a **self-similar** pattern.

Unlike Mandelbrot/Julia fractals, which are based on complex numbers, the Sierpinski Triangle is a **geometric fractal**.  
In this implementation, PyTorch tensors and GPU parallelism are used to compute the fractal efficiently.

## ðŸš€ How it Works
- A grid of coordinates `(x, y)` is generated using `torch.meshgrid`.  
- The fractal pattern is defined by a simple **bitwise rule**:
